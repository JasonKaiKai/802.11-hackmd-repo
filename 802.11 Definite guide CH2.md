# CH2 Overview of 802.11
![](https://i.imgur.com/Abj0AFI.png)

* 802.11 is just another link layer that can use the 802.2/LLC encapsulation
* The base 802.11 specification includes the 802.11 MAC and two physical layers
    * **FHSS**:  frequency-hopping spread-spectrum physical layer: periodically changing the signal's carrier frequency, While at any given moment the transmitter is functioning as a simple narrowband transmitter, after a predetermined time, the frequency changes, causing the information-bearing signal to move. And the net result is that over a period of time the transmission has been spread across a wide frequency band or spectrum
    * **DSSS**: direct-sequence spread-spectrum link layer:  It relies on a circuit to convolve the data stream with a spreading code. The method resists interference by mixing the data signal with a PN code, a noise-like sequence of bits or chips valued 0 and 1. The resulting signal bandwidth becomes much larger, hence the term "spread spectrum." The receiving system applies the same PN code to the received signal to extract/decode the information.
* 802.11 splits the PHY into two generic PMcomponents: 
    * PLCP: map the MAC frames onto the medium
    * PMD:

### Type of networks
**BSS**: simply a group of stations that communicate with each other, IBSS=> Independent BSS

**BSA**: Communications take place within a somewhat fuzzy area

![](https://i.imgur.com/KTzQapn.png)

**IBSS**: 分散式傳輸，沒有一個master ap，任兩點都可以互相傳輸而不用透過中繼點

**Infrastructure BSS**: 任兩點的傳輸都需要透過AP

### Extended Service area (ESS)
BSSs can create coverage in small offices and homes, but they cannot provide network coverage to larger areas

802.11 allows wireless networks of arbitrarily large size to be created by linking BSSs into an extended service set (**ESS**). An ESS is created by chaining BSSs together with a backbone network. All the access points in an ESS are given the same service set identifier (**SSID**)

*補充: EBSSID可以多個AP共用一個，但BSSID必須是唯一


#### Multi BSS environment "Virtual AP"
例子: 有一個網路必須區分 guest與 trust user
作法: 可以在同一個physical infrastructure下創造兩個不同的ESS，來實作VLAN
*  Current 802.11 chipsets can create multiple networks with the same radio. Using modern chipsets, each access point hardware device can create two BSSs. one for the network named guest, and one for the network named internal.
* Within the AP, each SSIDs is associated with a VLAN


## Distribution syetem overview
The distribution system is responsible for tracking where a station is physically located and delivering frames appropriately

* part of the delivery mechanism is the backbone Ethernet, but the backbone network cannot be the entire distribution system because it has no way of choosing between access points. In the language of 802.11, the backbone Ethernet is the **distribution system medium**
* To find the rest of the distribution system, we need to look to the access points themselves. Most access points currently on the market operate as bridges. They have at least one wireless network interface and at least one Ethernet network interface.Relaying frames between the two network media is controlled by a bridging engine.

**IAPP**(Interaccess point protocol): If a wireless station associated with AP4 sends a frame to a station associated with AP1, the bridging engine inside AP4 must send the frame over the backbone Ethernet to AP1 so it can be delivered to its ultimate destination. AP 的backbone network使用IAPP。簡單說，IAPP規範AP之間的轉換與漫遊，目前規範在802.11f。IAPP协议是IEEE 802.11工作组制订的用于AP间互通的协议．它的主要功能是便于扩展服务集ESS的创建和维护，支持802.11移动站点在AP间的移动，保证每个移 动站点在确定时刻与AP间只有一个连接关系。

* The wireless distribution system (WDS) configuration is often called a “**wireless bridge**” configuration because it allows network engineers to connect two LANs at the link layer

## 802.11 Network operation
* Stations are identified by **48-bit** IEEE 802 MAC addresse

### Network Services
![](https://i.imgur.com/TOnsVp9.png)
(1) The service provider can be either the station or the DS. Station services are implemented in every 802.11 station, including AP stations. Distribution services are provided between BSSs; these services may be implemented in an AP or in another special-purpose device attached to the distribution system.

(2) Three of the services are used to control IEEE 802.11 LAN access and confidentiality. Six of the services are used to support delivery of MAC service data units (MSDUs) between stations. 
    The MSDU is a block of data passed down from the MAC user to the MAC layer; typically this is a LLC PDU. If the MSDU is too large to be transmitted in a single MAC frame, it may be fragmented and transmitted in a series of MAC frames.

* *Distribution*: 將MSDU正確地傳到destination BSS
* *Integration*: 
    it allows the connection of the distribution system to a non-IEEE 802.11 network.
* *Association*: Delivery of frames to mobile stations
* *Reassociation*: 
    When a mobile station moves between basic service areas within a single extended service area, it must evaluate signal strength and perhaps switch the access point with which it is associated. Reassociation are never initiated directly by the access point.
    Each access point typically transmits a beacon signal every 100ms. Roaming stations use the beacon to gauge the strength of their existing access point connection. If the station senses a weak signal, the roaming station can implement the reassociation service to connect to an access point emitting a stronger signal.
* *Disassociation*: 與station中斷連線
* *Authentication*: 
    Authentication is a necessary prerequisite to association because only authenticated users are authorized to use the network.
* *Deauthentication*: clears keying information
* *Confidentiality*: WEP
* *MSDU delivery*:
* *Transmit Power Control (TPC)*: 避免interference, By controlling power to a level that is “just right,” it is less likely that a station will interfere with neighboring stations. 定義在802.11h

### Mobility support
802.11 provides mobility between basic service areas at the link layer.
When designing deploying 802.11, networks engineers must take care so that the seamless transition at the radio layer is also supported at the network protocol layer that the station IP address can be preserved. As far as 802.11 is concerned, there are three types of transitions between access points:
* No transition: 
    When stations do not move out of their current access point’s service area
* BSS transition:
    Within an Extended service area, 802.11 provides MAC layer mobility.
    如Fig 2-9,假設3個ap在同一個ESS, When the laptop moves out of AP1’s basic service area and into AP2’s at t=2, a BSS transition occurs. The mobile station uses the *reassociation service* to associate with AP2. AP2 needs to inform AP1 that the mobile station is now associated with AP2 (802.11並不規範怎麼通知)

* ESS transition
    * 802.11 does not support this type of transition.
    * Higher layer connections are almost guaranteed to be interrupted
    * Maintaining higher-level connections requires support from the protocol suites in question. In the case of TCP/ IP, Mobile IP is required to seamlessly support an ESS transition.
    * 補充: 要實現ESS transition, 必須要maintain同樣的IP address

## Designing Networks for Mobility
每個AP都會有一組SSID, client根據ssid去連線ap

:::info
補充
服務集識別碼（英語：Service Set Identifier，SSID）是一個或一組基礎架構模式無線網路的標識，依照標識方式又可細分為兩種：

* 基本服務集識別碼（BSSID），表示的是AP的資料鏈路層的MAC位址
* 擴充服務集定識別碼（ESSID），一個最長32位元組區分大小寫的字串，表示無線網路的名稱多個AP可以擁有同一個ESSID以對客戶提供漫遊能力，但是BSSID必須唯一，因為資料鏈路層的MAC位址是唯一的。

==多個AP可以擁有同一個ESSID以對客戶提供漫遊能力，但是BSSID必須唯一，因為資料鏈路層的MAC位址是唯一的。==
一個全為1的BSSID表示廣播，一般用於檢查可用無線存取點。
