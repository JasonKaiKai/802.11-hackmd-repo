# 802.11 Definite guide CH3 - MAC Fundamentals

# CH3 802.11 MAC Fundamental
### RF link quality
* 在unlicensed ISM bands裡，interference一定會發生，無線網路必須克服他
*  Multipath fading也是一項挑戰
*  All transmitted frames in 802.11 must be acknowledged(ACK)
*   802.11 allows stations to lock out contention during atomic operations so that atomic sequences are not interrupted by other stations attempting to use the transmission medium.
*   Radio link quality:  Signal quality degrades with range
*    Stations must implement a method for determining when to change the data rate in response to changing conditions

### The Hidden Node Problem
* Collisions resulting from hidden nodes may be hard to detect in wireless networks because wireless transceivers are generally *half-duplex*

![](https://i.imgur.com/yDf36Ms.png =550x)

* **RTS**:in addition to reserving the radio link for transmission, it silences any stations that hear it
* **CTS**:  silences stations in the immediate vicinity

The multiframe RTS/CTS transmission procedure consumes a fair amount of capacity. It is used only in high-capacity environments and environments with significant contention on transmission. For lower-capacity environments, it is not necessary.

大部分情況下不太會有Hidden node，因為現代AP coverage都夠廣，現實生活中ap可以連的區域都很小。可以透過設定 RTS threshold (看裝置有沒有提供)來決定要不要啟動，當frame大小大於這個threahold再啟動

## MAC Access Modes and Timing
* Access to the wireless medium is controlled by coordination functions
* **CSMA/CA** access is provided by the distributed coordination function (**DCF**)
*  If contention-free service is required, it can be provided by the point coordination function(**PCF**), which is built on top of the DCF
*  hybrid coordination function (**HCF**)介於PCF與DCF中間
*   Contention-free services are provided only in infrastructure networks，因為Contention free一定要有一個master角色

![](https://i.imgur.com/2V3w8qp.png =550x)

**DCF**
* The DCF is the basis of the standard CSMA/CA access mechanism.
* stations use a random backoff after each frame, with the first transmitter seizing the channel
*  In some circumstances, the DCF may use the CTS/RTS clearing technique to further reduce the possibility of collisions

**PCF**
* provides contention-free services
* Special stations called *point coordinators* are used to ensure that the medium is provided without contention
* 一定要是infrastructure networks
* PCF priority 大於 DCF

**HCF**
* The HCF allows stations to maintain multiple service queues and balance access to the wireless medium in favor of applications that require better service quality
* 尚未標準化，但在802.11e有提到

### Carrier-Sensing Functions and the Network Allocation Vector
Two types of Carrier sensing: physical carrier-sensing vs virtual carrier sensing

*  It is difficult to build physical carrier-sensing hardware for RF-based media
*  Virtual carrier-sensing is provided by the Network Allocation Vector (**NAV**)
    *   Most 802.11 frames carry a **duration field**, which can be used to reserve the medium for a fixed time period.
* **NAV**: A timer that indicates the amount of time the medium will be reserved, in microseconds.  Stations set the NAV to the time for which they expect to use the medium
    * The NAV is carried in the frame headers on the RTS and CTS frames; it is depicted on its own line to show how the NAV relates to actual transmissions in the air
    * 如Fig 3-5,接收者的 CTS發送時會在其header帶NAV長度，告訴其他人不要傳frame干擾到接收者接收資料
![](https://i.imgur.com/gi5DzpG.png)

* 當傳送完成後，隔一段**DIFS**，其他station又可以開始搶資源

### Interframe Spacing
![](https://i.imgur.com/TCqK2aj.png)
* 802.11定義四種 Interframe spacing，代表四種priority
* Different physical layers can specify different interframe space times.

**SIFS**
RTS、CTS、ACK
**PIFS**
Contention free的服務可以優先傳送
**DIFS**
minimum medium idle time for contention-based services
**EIFS**
used only when there is an error in frame transmission.

## Contention-Based Access Using the DCF
DCF may be used in either IBSS networks or in infrastructure networks

Before attempting to transmit, each station checks whether the medium is idle. If the medium is not idle, stations defer to each other and employ an orderly exponential backoff algorithm to avoid collisions.

DCF規則:
* Before attempting to transmit, each station checks whether the medium is idle. If the medium is not idle, stations defer to each other and employ an orderly exponential backoff algorithm to avoid collisions.
    *  If the previous frame was received without errors, the medium must be free for at least the DIFS.
    *  If the previous transmission contained errors, the medium must be free for the amount of the EIFS.
*  If the medium is busy, the station must wait for the channel to become idle. 802.11將之稱為 *access deferral*. 
    If access is deferred, the station waits for the medium to be idle for the DIFS and prepares for the exponential backoff procedure.
    
額外規則:
1.  Error recovery是Sender的責任，sender沒接到ACK必須重傳
    * All unicast data must be acknowledged. Broadcast data is not acknowledged.
    * there is a longer congestion window when transmissions are retried (CH4)
2.  When a station receives a medium reservation that is longer than the current NAV, it updates the NAV. Setting the NAV is done on a frame-by-frame basis
3.  Once a station has transmitted the first frame in a sequence, it has gained control of the channel. Any additional frames and their acknowledgments can be sent using the short interframe space, which locks out any other stations.
4. Extended frame sequences are required for higher-level packets that are larger than configured thresholds.
    * ==Packets larger than the RTS threshold must have RTS/CTS exchange.==
    * ==Packets larger than the fragmentation threshold must be fragmented.==

### Error Recovery with the DCF
* When an error is detected, the station with data must resend the frame.
* Errors must be detected by the sending station
* **Retry counters** are incremented when frames are retransmitted. (retry counter 每個frame或 fragment一個)
*  Stations有兩個 retry counters:
    1. short retry counter: 長度比RTS threshold 還小的frame為short。
    2. long retry counter: 反之
* The short retry count is reset to 0 when:
    *  A CTS frame is received in response to a transmitted RTS
    *  A MAC-layer ack is received after a nonfragmented transmission
    *  A broadcast or multicast frame is received
* The long retry count is reset to 0 when:
    * A MAC-layer ack is received for a frame longer than the RTS threshold
    * A broadcast or multicast frame is received
* fragments are given a maximum “**lifetime**” by the MAC. 
    When the first fragment is transmitted, the lifetime counter is started. When the lifetime limit is reached, the frame is discarded and no attempt is made to transmit any remaining fragments
* If the retry limit is reached, the frame is discarded, and its loss is reported to higher-layer protocols.

### Backoff with the DCF
After frame transmission has completed and the DIFS has elapsed, stations may attempt to transmit congestion-based data, need backoff time.

**Backoff window (contention window)**
* Divided into slot
*  Slot length is medium-dependent; higher-speed physical layers use shorter slot times
*   Stations pick a random slot and wait for that slot before attempting to access the medium
*  Contention window sizes are always 1 less than a power of 2 (e.g., 31, 63, 127, 255).
* retry count+1, contention window size increase next greatest power of 2
* When the contention window reaches its maximum size, it remains there until it can be reset.

## Fragmentation and Reassembly

Fragmentation可以減少interference的影響

* Higher-level packets and some large management frames may need to be broken into smaller pieces to fit through the wireless channel
* By immediately reducing the amount of data that can be corrupted by interference, fragmentation may result in a higher effective throughput
*  Fragmentation takes place when the length of a higher-level packet exceeds the fragmentation threshold
*   Fragments all have the ==same frame sequence number== but have ascending fragment numbers to aid in reassembly
*   All of the fragments that comprise a frame are normally sent in a **fragmentation burst**, which is shown in Figure 3-8.
![](https://i.imgur.com/SrkWv5i.png =550x)

As with any RTS/CTS exchange, the RTS and CTS both set the NAV from the expected time to the end of the first fragments in the air

Each fragment sets the NAV to hold the medium until the end of the ack for the next frame.

Fragment 0 sets the NAV to hold the medium until ACK 1, fragment 1 sets the NAV to hold the medium until ACK 2

## Frame Format
ref:http://www.tsnien.idv.tw/Network_WebBook/chap15/15-6%20%E8%A8%8A%E6%A1%86%E6%A0%BC%E5%BC%8F.html

![](https://i.imgur.com/i97trGM.png =650x)

encapsulation details such as type and length are present in the header on the data carried in the 802.11 frame.

### Frame control
Each frame starts with a two-byte Frame Control subfield, shown in Figure 3-10

![](https://i.imgur.com/I04xxNl.png =650x)

**Protocol version**
802.11 default都是0，只有特殊版本才會是1

**Type and subtype fields**
Frame type，參考 table 3-1，每種frame都有其對應的type
* Management frames (type=00)
* Control frames (type=01)
* Data frames (type=10)
* reserve (type=11)

![](https://i.imgur.com/7PGcvFk.png =400x)
![](https://i.imgur.com/iF7sIeD.png =500x)
![](https://i.imgur.com/hcMG79o.png =400x)




1. **ToDS and FromDS bits**
    These bits indicate whether a frame is destined for the distribution system

![](https://i.imgur.com/XBY6k2v.png =550x)

2. **More fragments bit**
     When a higher-level packet has been fragmented by the MAC, the initial fragment and any following nonfinal fragments set this bit to 1 
3. **Retry bit**
    Any retransmitted frames set this bit to 1 to aid the receiving station in eliminating duplicate frames.
4. **Power management bit**
    many small devices have the ability to power down parts of the network interface.

    This bit indicates whether the sender will be in a powersaving mode after the completion of the current atomic frame exchange
    * 1: station will be power saving mode
    * 0: active
    
    ==AP的這欄必須一直是 0==，因為AP有許多重要的Management frame要收送
5. **More data bit**
    To accommodate stations in a powersaving mode, access points may buffer frames received from the distribution system. 
    An access point sets this bit to indicate that at least one frame is available and is addressed to a dozing station.
6. **Protected Frame bit**
    If the frame is protected by link layer security protocols, this bit is set to 1, 又稱"WEP bit"
7. **Order bit**
    When the “strict ordering” delivery is employed, this bit is set to 1.

**Duration/ID Field**
![](https://i.imgur.com/j9yEX2Z.png)

Duration: setting the NAV
1. When bit 15 is 0, used to set the NAV.
2. During the contention-free periods, bit 14 is 0 and bit 15 is 1. All other bits are 0, so the duration/ID field takes a value of 32,768. 
    This value is interpreted as a NAV. It allows any stations that did not receive the Beacon* announcing the contention-free period to update the NAV with a suitably large value to avoid interfering with contention-free transmissions.

**PS-Poll frame**
 Bits 14 and 15 are both set to 1 in PS-Poll frames. Mobile stations may elect to save battery power. Dozing stations must wake up periodically. 

To ensure that no frames are lost, stations awaking from their slumber transmit a PS-Poll frame to retrieve any buffered frames from the access poin. 睡醒時，問問看AP有沒有bufferd起來的資料

**Address Fields (48 bits)**
The general thumb:
 * **Address 1** is used for the receiver (Destination addr)
 * **Address 2** for the transmitter (Source addr)
 * **Address 3** field for filtering by the receiver (BSSID)

For example, the third address field is used by the receiver to determine whether the frame is part of the network it is associated to.

* Addresses are **48 bits** long
*  If the first bit sent to the physical medium is a 0, the address represents a single station (**unicast**)
*   When the first bit is a 1, the address represents a group of physical stations and is called a **multicast** (or group) address.
*   All bits 1: **broadcast**

48-bit addresses are used for a variety of purposes:
* Destination address
* Source address
* Receiver address
* Transmitter address
* Basic Service Set ID (BSSID)

**Sequence Control Field (16 bits)**
![](https://i.imgur.com/YQQJ1ZA.png =550x)

* used for both defragmentation and discarding duplicate frames
* Higher-level frames are each given a sequence number as they are passed to the MAC for transmission
* Sequence num 每4096循環一次(回到1)
* 如果frame被分成fragment，則每個fragment都有相同sequence num，但有不同fragment num
* frame重傳，sequence num不會變

**Frame Body**
* Higher level的payload
* 802.11 can transmit frames with a maximum payload of *2,304* bytes of higher-level data
*   Preventing fragmentation must be done at the protocol layerOn IP networks, Path MTU Discovery (RFC 1191) will prevent the transmission of frames with Data fields larger than 1,500 bytes

802.11特色
1.  there is no higher-level protocol tag in the 802.11 frame to distinguish between higher-layer protocol types. Higher-level protocols are tagged with a type field by an additional header
2.  802.11 does not generally pad frames to a minimum length. Many frames used by 802.11 are short

**Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**
* 又稱CRC

## Encapsulation of Higher-Layer　Protocols Within 802.11
* 802.11 需要802.2 LLC level來轉換高階protocol的封裝
* LLC詳細: http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~nfhuang/chap03.htm
![](https://i.imgur.com/mtBgzop.png =600x)

LLC封裝有兩種: 
1. RFC1042 (IETF encapsulation) 
2. 802.1H (tunnel encapsulation)

兩者皆是 802.2’s sub-network access protocol
(SNAP) 的產物，兩者唯一的差別在於OUI的使用

SNAP header
*  destination service access point (DSAP)
*  source service access point (SSAP)
![](https://i.imgur.com/7lHGEVU.png =400x)


### Contention-Based Data Service
 Two distinct sets of atomic exchanges are defined by 802.11.
 * DCF
 * PCF

### Broadcast and Multicast Data or Management Frames
Broadcast and multicast frames 又稱 **group frame**
廣播不需要ACK，也不能被fragmented
* Broadcast data frames with a broadcast address in the Address 1 field
* Multicast data frames with a multicast address in the Address 1 field
* Broadcast management frames with a broadcast address in the Address 1 field(Beacon, Probe Request, and IBSS ATIM frames)

Because the frame exchange is a single-frame sequence, the NAV is set to 0.

### Unicast frame
* Frames that are destined for a single station are called **directed data** by the 802.11 standard
* Unicast frame 需要ACK

#### Basic positive acknowledgment (ﬁnal fragment)
![](https://i.imgur.com/pne5pgK.png =550x)
The frame uses the NAV to reserve the medium for the frame, its ack, and the intervening SIFS

#### Fragmentation
* Disadvantage of network-layer fragmentation:  
Rreassembly is performed by the final destination; if any of the fragments are lost, the entire packet must be retransmitted
* Link layers may incorporate fragmentation to boost speed over a single hop with a small MTU
* 802.11 can also use fragmentation to help avoid interference.
 
Basic fragmentation如下圖
![](https://i.imgur.com/fqTmdQc.png =500x)
* all frames prior to the penultimate frame use the NAV to lock the medium for the next frame. The first data frame sets the NAV for a long enough period to accommodate its ACK, the next fragment, and the acknowledgment following the next fragment.
*  the MAC sets the More Fragments bit in the frame control field to 1
*   final data frame, which sets the More Fragments bit to 0, and the final ACK, which sets the NAV to 0.

#### RTS/CTS
*  The NAV in the RTS allows the CTS to complete
*  and the CTS is used to reserve access for the data frame.
![](https://i.imgur.com/SjqeBE7.png =550x)

**RTS/CTS threshold**
RTS/CTS behavior is controlled by a threshold set in the driver software. Frames larger than the threshold are preceded by an RTS/CTS exchange to clear the medium, while smaller frames are simply transmitted.
(一定大小以上的frame才需要RTS/CTS程序，不然直接傳送就好)

#### RTS/CTS with fragmentation
![](https://i.imgur.com/cG9FHdt.png =550x)

### Powersaving Sequences

Low power ref
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/21623985

* 802.11 stations can maximize battery life by shutting down the radio transceiver and sleeping periodically.
* 在睡眠期間, AP will buffer any unicast frames for sleeping stations. These frames are announced by subsequent Beacon frames
*  To retrieve buffered frames, newly awakened stations use PS-Poll frames.

AP 在接到PS-Poll後，會有兩種回復data的方式:
**Immediate response**
![](https://i.imgur.com/v9AWtg9.png =550x)

The PS-Poll frame contains an **Association ID** in the Duration/ID field so that the access point can determine which frames were buffered for the mobile station

The MAC specification requires all stations receiving a PS-Poll to update the NAV with an implied value equal to a short interframe space and one ACK


Fig 3-20 shows immediate PS-Poll response requiring fragmentation
![](https://i.imgur.com/pkONihz.png =550x)

**Deferred response**
AP can also respond with a simple ack, called *Deferred response*
![](https://i.imgur.com/0QrniCT.png =550x)
* A station requesting a frame with a PS-Poll must stay awake until it is delivered.
* A station cannot return to a low-power mode until it receives a Beacon frame in which its bit in the traffic indication map (**TIM**) is clear.
*  In FIG 3-21, Station transmits a PS-Poll to the AP to retrieve the buffered frames. However, the access point may choose to defer its response by transmitting only an ACK
*  After receiving a data frame, the station must remain awake until the next Beacon is transmitted. 
*  **Beacon frames** only note whether frames are buffered for a station and have no way of indicating the number of frames. 
*  Once the station receives a Beacon frame indicating that no more traffic is buffered, it can conclude that it has received the last buffered frame and return to a low-power mode.
*  Beacon frame是為了告訴STA已經將buffer的data傳送完畢，可以回到low power模式了

補充:
AID的分配：当一个节点（STA）向AP发起关联请求（Association Request）后，AP会反馈的关联相应帧（Association Response）。AID也是在这个过程中被分配，并告知节点（PS：在重关联过程中，该AID也会被分配，不过这里我们并不讨论）。如下图，是一个Association Response帧格式其中就包含了Association ID这个参数。
![](https://i.imgur.com/4MC9eIL.png)


TIM ref: https://network.blog.csdn.net/article/details/52167007

### Multirate Support
* Stations may also change speed frequently in response to rapid changes in the radio environment.
* 如何變速spec並沒有規定，由各家廠商去implement

General rule:
1. Every STA maintains a list of *operational rates*, which is the list of rates that are supported by both the station and the BSS serving it
2. Every BSS must also maintain a **basic rate set**, which is a list of data rates that must be supported by every station joining the BSS. Any frame sent to a group receiver address must be transmitted at a basic rate, ensuring that all stations can demodulate it correctly.
3. RTS and CTS frames must also be transmitted at one of the rates in the *basic rate set*. This rule ensures that a station which must transmit a CTS frame in response to an RTS frame can do so at the same rate.
    * **protection mode**: Protection mode is intended to prevent interference between a station supporting only an older, slower radio modulation and a newer station that supports faster radio modulations
4.  Response frames, such as acknowledgments or CTS frames, must be transmitted at a rate in the basic rate set, but no faster than the initial frame in the sequence was transmitted. 
    * Response frames must use the same modulation as the initial frame


## Frame Processing and Bridging
AP 為 802.11-to-Ethernet bridges

![](https://i.imgur.com/vcf94Z3.png)

### Wireless Medium to Wired Medium (802.11 to Ethernet)

步驟:
1. Check frame的完整性，包含 Physical layer headers 與 FCS
2. 檢查 frame 是否真的需要被process或被過濾掉
    1. Frames sent to an access point have the MAC address of the AP (the BSSID) in the Address 1 field of the 802.11 MAC header. Frames that do not match the BSSID of the AP should be discarded
    2. The 802.11 MAC 刪除重複的 frames. Frames may be duplicated for a variety of reasons, but one of the most common is that the 802.11 acknowledgment is lost or corrupted in transit
3. Decrypt frames protected
4. 檢查是否為fragment，是的話需重新組裝
5. Wireless MAC header 轉換為 Ethernet MAC header
    * The destination address(Address 3 field) is copied to the Ethernet destination address.
    *  The source address (Address 2 field) is copied to the Ethernet source address.
    *  The Ethernet type code is copied from the SNAP header in the 802.11 Data field to the Type code in the Ethernet frame. If the Ethernet frame uses SNAP as well, the entire SNAP header can be copied.
    * Sequence information is used in fragmentation reassembly, but is discarded when the frame is bridged.
    *  the QoS mapping from the wireless interface to the wired interface will occur here
6. The FCS is recalculated
7. The new frame is transmitted on the Ethernet interface.

### Wired Medium to Wireless Medium (Ethernet to 802.11)
步驟:
1. 檢查FCS，然後AP check destination address的STA屬於目前這個AP
2. The SNAP header is prepended to the data in the Ethernet frame
3. The frame is scheduled for transmission. 若有power saving，就必須等STA起床再傳
4. Once a frame has been queued for transmission, it is assigned a *sequence number*. 檢查是否需要fragment，assign fragment num
5. 將 frame 加密
6. 將Ethernet header 轉為 802.11 header
    * Ethernet destination address copy to 802.11 Address 1 field (destination addr)
    * Filled 802.11 Address 2 field (BSID) as the sender of the frame on the wireless medium.
    * Source address of the frame copy to 802.11 Address 3 field
    * Other fields in the 802.11 MAC header are filled in.
7. The FCS is recalculated.
8. The new frame is transmitted on the 802.11 interface.

### Quality of Service Extensions
