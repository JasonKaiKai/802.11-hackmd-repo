# 802.11 Definite guide CH4 - Framing in Detail
802.11有三種主要的frame type
1. Data frame
2. Control frame: 
    area-clearing operations, channel acquisition, carrier-sensing maintenance, ACK
4. Management frame:
    管理連線還有AP換手機制

# Data frame
Data frame的樣式
![](https://i.imgur.com/toPuUhY.png =550x)

Data frame的分類
![](https://i.imgur.com/fbe6cJK.png =550x)
* Any frames that appear only in the contention-free period can never be used in an IBSS.
* 只有CF的ACK屬於 data frame，Contention based的ack屬於control frame

## Frame Control欄
參考ch3

## Duration欄
用來放 NAV 值
補充: ==Contention free service 不需要設定NAV==

Rules:
1. Any frames transmitted during the contention-free period set the Duration field to 32,768 (0x8000)
2. Frames transmitted to a broadcast or multicast destination (Address 1 has the group bit set) have a duration of 0.
    With no link-layer acknowledgment following the transmission of a broadcast or multicast frame, there is no need to lock access to the medium for subsequent frames.
3. If the More Fragments bit in the Frame Control field is 0, The final fragment need only reserve the medium for its own ACK
![](https://i.imgur.com/RwA4iwI.png =500x)
4. If the More Fragments bit in the Frame Control field is set to 1. The Duration field is set to the amount of time (2*ACK + 3*SIFS + next Fragment)
    *  nonfinal fragments set the NAV just like an RTS would (Figure 4-3); for this reason, they are referred to as a **virtual RTS**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ihiZQzo.png =500x)

## Addressing and DS Bits欄
Addr field的填法會與DS bit的設定有關，如Table 4-2
![](https://i.imgur.com/BPsnzWP.png =500x)

*  If Address 1 is set to a broadcast or multicast address, the BSSID is also checked. STA會忽略不同BSS的廣播
    * Destination vs Receiver, 兩者是不同的
        The destination is the station that will process the network-layer packet contained in the frame; the receiver is the station that will attempt to decode the radio waves into an 802.11 frame
* Address 2 是用來告訴 Receiver ACK要回傳給誰
* Address 3 field is used for filtering by access points and the distribution system


In the case of an IBSS
* The transmitter is the source
* The receiver is the destination. 
* All frames carry the BSSID so that stations may check broadcasts and multicasts;

Table 4-2的四行各有一張圖解釋:
第二行 (To AP): 
![](https://i.imgur.com/JAl42SQ.png =500x)
第三行 (From AP):
![](https://i.imgur.com/fjRNxID.png =500x)

第四行 (WDS):
* 又稱 Wireless bridge
![](https://i.imgur.com/O3zxmBx.png =500x)

:::info
BSSID最大的功用就是filtering
Several distinct 802.11 networks may overlap physically, and there is no reason for one network to receive link-layer broadcasts from a physically overlapping network

Infrastructure BSS 的BSSID是 AP 的 MAC addr. The Universal/Local bit for the new BSSID is set to 1, indicating a local address, and the Individual/Group bit is set to 0
 
* BSSID全為1就是 broadcast BSSID,  BSSID broadcasts are used only when mobile stations try to locate a network by sending probe requests
*  Probe frames are the only frames allowed to use the broadcast BSSID
:::

## Variations on the Data Frame Theme
Here are the different data frame types that are commonly used:
1. Data:
    * Frames of the Data subtype are transmitted only during the contention-based access periods
2. Null:
    * They are used by mobile stations to inform the access point of changes in power-saving status.
    * STA用NULL Data frame來通知AP他的Power state的狀態，透過 Power Management bit in the Frame Control field，若為0，表示awake; 若為1，表示睡下去，這時 AP 就要幫他 buffer data
![](https://i.imgur.com/mipz2mA.png =500x)


剩餘的data frame subtype會在 ch9探討

## Applied Data Framing
**IBSS frames**
![](https://i.imgur.com/LzmZOCU.png =600x)
* IBSS data frames have the subtype data or Null; 
    The latter is used only to communicate power management state.

**Frames from the AP**
![](https://i.imgur.com/dkD5K3V.png =600x)
* 注意: 802.11明文規定 ==AP 不能進入 power saving，所以AP不能發送Null frame==

:::info
The split between source and transmitter is necessary because the 802.11 MAC sends ack to the frame’s transmitter (the access point), but higher layers send replies to the frame’s source.
:::

**CF-POLL補充**
PCF工作模式:
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/20750579
![](https://i.imgur.com/u8tK1ax.png =400x)
利用数据帧的MAC头部中的Duration字段，设置CFPMaxDuration。标准的Duartion字段共有16个字节[0:15]，其中倒数2个字节，即[14:15]是标志位，且其存放方式应该是属于小端模式的，即后面的是高位，前面的是低位。如果是CFP设置NAV时，对应第14位置0,第15位置1，其余各位都是0。故解析出来，那么NAV的时间即设置为2^15=32768 microsecond

![](https://i.imgur.com/sfim7EH.png =400x)

* 在PCF模式中，NAV的释放是通过CF-END帧，而非DCF的倒數

PCF中，AP充当中心协调控制器（PC）的角色，根据其内部的轮询表（polling list）依次轮询与之连接的节点（CF-Pollable STA），
轮询具体会采用CF-POLL帧来执行，节点接收到CF-POLL之后，向PC反馈数据


**Frames to the AP**
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVPb9od.png =600x)

**Frames in a WDS**
![](https://i.imgur.com/bfiGEZX.png =600x)

**Encrypted frames**
When a frame is handled by encryption, the Protected Frame bit in the Frame Control field is set to 1, and the Frame Body field begins with the appropriate cryptographic header

# Control frame
![](https://i.imgur.com/b4bIJrR.png =500x)
* *Protocol version*: 
    預設就是0，沒有別的值
* *Type*: 
    10就是control frame
* *subtype*: 
    RTS、CTS、ACK,......
* *ToDS、FromDS*: 
    Always 0. Control frames arbitrate access to the wireless medium and thus can only originate from wireless stations. The distribution system does not send or receive control frames.
* *More fragment bit*: 
    always0, control frame不 fragment
* *Retry*: 
    always 0. control frame不重傳
* *Pwr Mgmt*: 
    傳送 power state
* *More data bit*: 
    always 0
* *Protected Frame bit*
    Always 0
* *Order bit*
    Always 0
    
## RTS
broadcast and multicast frames 不需要RTS、CTS程序，可以直接傳

RTS frame如下:
![](https://i.imgur.com/2ss5mJT.png =550x)
*  subtype of RTS: 1011

:::warning
在spec裡，Sub type的bit 7 才是 Most significant bit
:::

*Duration*:
RTS會為接下來的frame exchange 預留 NAV，如下圖
![](https://i.imgur.com/YLNVxJ3.png =550x)

*Addr1、2*
分別為Reciever、Transmitter 的 addr

## CTS
CTS除了回復RTS的功能以外，還有protection的功能(在 ch 14描述)
![](https://i.imgur.com/TnHFL9h.png =550x)
* subtype of CTS: 0011

*Duration*
將前面RTS的NAV減掉 CTS 與 SIFS time就行了
![](https://i.imgur.com/M5MTYDN.png =550x)

*Addr 1*
Reciever address，copy from transmitter addr of RTS

## ACK
![](https://i.imgur.com/eeO29dH.png =550x)
* subtype: 1011

*Duration*
* ACKs for complete data frames and final fragments in a fragment burst set the duration to 0.
* If the More Fragments bit is 1, The Duration field is used like the Duration field in the CTS frame
* The 802.11 specification refers to the duration setting in the ACK frames as a **virtual CTS**.
![](https://i.imgur.com/eZzVdrH.png =550x)

Acknowledgments are transmitted in response to directed data frames, management frames, and PS-Poll frames.

## Power-Save Poll (PS-Poll)
When a mobile station wakes from a power-saving mode, it transmits a PS-Poll frame to the access point to retrieve any frames buffered while it was in power-saving mode.
![](https://i.imgur.com/gxYhjkX.png =550x)

*Frame control*
subtype: 1010

*Association ID (AID)*
取代duration field

*Addr1* : BSSID
*Addr2*: Transmitter addr

The PS-Poll frame does not include duration information to update the NAV. However, all stations receiving a PS-Poll frame update the NAV by the short interframe space + ACK time

:::info
**AID**
 When mobile stations associate with an access point, the access point assigns a value called the Association ID (AID)
:::
    

# Management frames

ref: http://osnet.cs.nchu.edu.tw/powpoint/seminar/802.11/802.11Framing%20in%20Detail.pdf

## The Structure of Management Frames
如Fig 4-20, The MAC header is the same in all management frames

Management frames use **information elements**, little chunks of data with a
numerical label, to communicate information to other systems.
![](https://i.imgur.com/K5CxQ9g.png =600x)

**Address ﬁelds**
Stations are required to inspect the BSSID after receiving a mangement frame. Only broadcast and multicast frames from the BSSID that a station is currently associated with are passed to MAC management layers.  
The one exception to this rule is Beacon frames,

正常情況下，BSSID 為 AP interface 之 MAC addr
若為IBSS，則 BSSID 為隨機分配

**Duration calculation**
rules: 
1. Any frames transmitted in the contention-free period set the duration to 32,768.
2. contention-based access periods:
    * If the frame is a broadcast or multicast (the destination address is a group address), the duration is 0
    * If a nonfinal fragment is part of a multiframe exchange, the duration is set to the number of microseconds that 
        `(3*SIFS + next Fragment + ACK)`
    * Final fragments: `1*ACK + SIFS`

**Frame body**

Most of the data contained in the frame body uses fixed-length fields called ++fixed fields++ and variable-length fields called **information elements**

Information elements are blobs of data of varying size. Each data blob is tagged with a type number and a size

* Information element 是可變長度

## Fixed-Length Management Frame Components
* Fixed-length fields 簡稱 *fields*
* Fields do not have a header to distinguish them from other parts of the frame body.


接著介紹10種 Fields:
Authentication Algorithm Number
Authentication Transaction Sequence Number
Beacon interval
Capability Information
Current AP Address
Listen interval
Association ID
Timestamp
Reason Code
Status Code

### Authentication Algorithm Number
 This field identifies the type of authentication used in the initial 802.11-level authentication process  before association occurs.
![](https://i.imgur.com/kiIS94l.png =550x)
![](https://i.imgur.com/vz37HKw.png =400x)

整理在一起就如下圖，上述bit會出現在Frame body的前一小部分
![](https://i.imgur.com/puK6R6y.png =600x)

### Authentication Transaction Sequence Number
Used to track progress through the authentication exchange.
永遠不為0
![](https://i.imgur.com/omN3w8Y.png =550x)

### Beacon interval
Beacon frames carry information about the BSS parameters and the frames buffered by access points, so mobile stations must listen to Beacons.
* 用來表示 time units(TU) between Beacon transmissions.
* TU的單位為 1024ms
* 比較常見設法會是 100 TU
![](https://i.imgur.com/6Cs4MTv.png =550x)

### Capability Information
Used in Beacon transmissions to advertise the network’s capabilities. 

In this field, each bit is used as a flag to advertise a particular function of the network.  Stations use the capability advertisement to determine whether they can support all the features in the BSS
![](https://i.imgur.com/hZNbcdd.png =550x)

各欄位解釋請看書

*Short Slot Time*: 802.11g
*DSSS-OFDM* : 802.11g 
*Contention-free polling bits*: 
![](https://i.imgur.com/t2VcO16.png =550x)

### Current AP Address
When an association is established with a different access point, this field can be used to transfer the association and retrieve any buffered frames.
![](https://i.imgur.com/OuNpEd7.png =500x)

### Listen interval
To save battery power, stations may shut off the antenna units in 802.11 network interfaces. While stations are sleeping, access points must buffer frames for them.

Dozing stations periodically wake up to listen to traffic announcements to determine whether the access point has any buffered frames. 

When stations associate with an AP, part of the saved data is the **Listen Interval**, which is the number of Beacon intervals that stations wait between listening for Beacon frames.

* Higher listen intervals require more access point memory for frame buffering.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7lPAVdJ.png =500x)

### Association ID
由AP assign給 STA
*  To maintain compatibility with the Duration/ID field in the MAC header, the two most significant bits are set to 1.

![](https://i.imgur.com/FtYvnYE.png =500x)

### Timestamp
* The master timekeeper for a BSS periodically transmits the number of microseconds it has been active
* 用於計時
![](https://i.imgur.com/MKbER1h.png =500x)

### Reason Code
當 Sender 沒有正常地加入 Network，STA會傳送 Disassociation 或 Deauthentication frames，其中reason code這欄會用來傳送錯誤代碼
![](https://i.imgur.com/KTswDyV.png =500x)
![](https://i.imgur.com/eptylV6.png =550x)
![](https://i.imgur.com/dW70qSJ.png =550x)

Status codes indicate the success or failure of an operation.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7qzBvZJ.png =500x)
![](https://i.imgur.com/BOyJZDY.png =550x)

## Management Frame Information Elements
Information Elements為可變長度
Fig 4-31為 information element格式
![](https://i.imgur.com/IeSO7to.png =550x)

Element ID 表
![](https://i.imgur.com/mjSXbNR.png =600x)

### Service Set Identity (SSID)
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ar8px9q.png =550x)

The SSID is the same for all the basic service areas composing an extended service area.
又稱 *network name*

* SSID 全 0為 ++broadcast SSID++
    it is used only in Probe Request frames when a station attempts to discover all the 802.11 networks in its area.

### Supported Rates
When mobile stations attempt to join the network, they check the data rates used in the network.

Some rates are mandatory and others are optional.

It consists of a string of bytes. Each byte uses the seven low-order bits for the data rate; the most significant bit indicates whether the data rate is mandatory
![](https://i.imgur.com/TvlShMS.png =600x)

![](https://i.imgur.com/4zAEvpY.png =350x)


### FH Parameter Set
Used on frequency-hopping, see CH 12
![](https://i.imgur.com/HxqThA7.png =500x)

### DS Parameter Set
![](https://i.imgur.com/dovRTfE.png =550x)

Direct-sequence para

### Trafﬁc Indication Map (TIM)
![](https://i.imgur.com/dIYvOiU.png =500x)

Send the Traffic Indication Map (TIM) information element (Figure 4-36) to the network to indicate which stations have buffered traffic waiting to be picked up.
又稱 **virtual bitmap**，MAP裡有 2008 個 bits，每個bit對應一個Association ID，若 1 則表示有 buffered frame，0則表示沒有

### CF Parameter Set
The CF Parameter Set information element is transmitted in Beacons by AP

Contention-free
### IBSS Parameter Set
![](https://i.imgur.com/TbSIP78.png =500x)

It indicates the number of time units (TUs) between ATIM frames in an IBSS.

### Country

### Hopping Pattern Parameters and Hopping Pattern Table

Used in frequency hopping, see CH11.

### Request
![](https://i.imgur.com/YJ4UFBU.png =550x)

在 Probe Request frames 的 frame body裡 
The Request information element is used to ask the network for certain information elements.

### Challenge Text
Used in shared-key authentication system

### Power Constraint
![](https://i.imgur.com/XQ3ngW1.png =500x)

Allow a network to describe the maximum transmit power to stations.

If, for example, the regulatory maximum power were 10 dBm, but this information element contained the value 2, then the station would set its maximum transmit power to 8 dBm

### Power Capability
![](https://i.imgur.com/HMnHIEl.png =550x)
 
The Power Capability information element allows a station to report its minimum and maximum transmit power, in integer units of dBm

### TPC Request
![](https://i.imgur.com/s7coJ1M.png =550x)

The Transmit Power Control (TPC) Request information element is used to request radio link management information.

### TPC Report
![](https://i.imgur.com/5OU1qV5.png =550x)

For stations to know how to tune transmission power, it helps to know the attenuation on the link

The first, the transmit power, is the transmit power of the frame containing the information element, in units of dBm. The second, the link margin, represents the number of decibels of safety that the station requires

見 CH8

### Supported Channels
![](https://i.imgur.com/QUTWpRI.png =550x)

For example, a device that only supported channels 40 through 52 would set the first channel number to 40, and the number of channels to 12.

### Channel Switch Announcement
![](https://i.imgur.com/qRNu1qm.png =550x)

802.11h added the ability of networks to dynamically switch channels.
This is to warn stations in the network about the impending channel change

* *Channel Switch Mode*:
    When the operating channel is changed, it disrupts communication. 
    * 設 1, associated stations should stop transmitting frames until the channel switch has occurred. 
    * 設 0, there is no restriction on frame transmission.
* *New Channel Number*: 
    The new channel number after the switch.
* *Channel Switch Count*:
     This field is the number of Beacon frame transmission intervals that it will take to change the channel
     
### Measurement Request and Measurement Report
802.11h, see CH8

### Quiet
![](https://i.imgur.com/djH4PZo.png =550x)
用於避開軍事雷達


### IBSS DFS
![](https://i.imgur.com/Qhu9ZPx.png =550x)

In an infrastructure network, the AP is responsible for dynamic frequency selection. Independent networks must have a designated owner of the dynamic frequency selection (DFS) algorithm

### ERP Information
802.11g defined the extended rate PHY (ERP), see CH12
![](https://i.imgur.com/vzNCVyV.png =550x)

### Robust Security Network (RSN)
![](https://i.imgur.com/9c5J5CJ.png =550x)

### Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)

## Types of Management Frames
Beacon, Probe Request
Probe Response, 
IBSS announcement trafﬁc indication map (ATIM)
Disassociation and Deauthentication
Association Request
Reassociation Request
Association Response and Reassociation Response
Authentication
Action frame

### Beacon
![](https://i.imgur.com/TxlP630.png =600x)

由AP定期發送，讓STA知道目前有哪些AP在附近
*  Only one physical layer can be in use at any point, so the FH and DS Parameter Sets are mutually exclusive.
*  CF Parameter Set is used only in frames generated by access points that support the PCF
*  TIM element is used only in Beacons generated by AP, because only AP perform frame buffering.

### Probe Request
![](https://i.imgur.com/mVYWFhP.png =600x)

由 mobile station 發送

AP that receive Probe Requests use the information to determine whether the mobile station can join the network

### Probe Response
![](https://i.imgur.com/kem2Hlm.png =600x)

由 AP 發送

The station that sent the last Beacon is responsible for responding to incoming probes. In infrastructure networks, this station is the AP. In an IBSS, responsibility for Beacon transmission is distributed

* The same rules apply to Probe Response frames as to Beacon frames.  The Probe Response frame carries all the parameters in a Beacon frame
* Probe Response不需要 TIM欄位，因為根本還沒Associate，何來的 buffered frame for TIM

### IBSS announcement trafﬁc indication map (ATIM)
![](https://i.imgur.com/Sitz6bw.png =600x)

IBSSs have no access points and therefore cannot rely on access points for buffering.

IBSS 裡負責buffer frame的人為STA

When a station in an IBSS has buffered frames for a receiver in low-power mode, it sends an ATIM frame during the delivery period to notify the recipient it has buffered data

### Disassociation and Deauthentication
![](https://i.imgur.com/kbjnw9j.png =600x)

Disassociation frames are used to end an association relationship
Deauthentication frames are used to end an authentication relationship

補充: STA與AP的連線過程為 Authentication -> Association

### Association Request

![](https://i.imgur.com/6gg8Syw.png =600x)

STA 用來請求連線
* Capability Information field: to indicate the type of network the mobile station wants to join.
* AP 收到 Association Request，會先檢查 Capability Information, SSID, Supported Rates 都與 network match，才會接受連線請求
* Listen Interval: Used to tell AP that how often a mobile station listens to Beacon frames to monitor the TIM.

### Reassociation Request
![](https://i.imgur.com/fqzMh8R.png =600x)

Mobile stations moving between basic service areas within the same extended service area need to reassociate with the network before using the distribution system again.

當 STA 短暫離開 BSA 的範圍又再重新回來，這時就需要 reassociation

Association and Reassociation Requests 唯一差別 : 
Reassociation Request includes the address of the mobile station’s current access point. 

Including this information allows the new access point to contact the old access point and transfer the association data. The transfer may include frames that were buffered at the old access point.

### Association Response and Reassociation Response
![](https://i.imgur.com/QB9xWXU.png =600x)

As part of the response, the access point assigns an Association ID，如何 assign ID 則是各家廠商自己決定

Association Response 與 Reassociation Response 只差在Frame control 的 subtype 欄位

### Authentication
![](https://i.imgur.com/9nAUH5C.png =600x)

At the beginning of 802.11 networking, stations authenticated using a shared key, and exchanged Authentication frames
* *Authentication Algorithm Number*: for algorithm selection
* *Seq No.*:  for each frame in the authentication exchange process
    
If a station uses shared key authentication, it will not be allowed to use the strong security protocols described in Chapter 8.

### Action frame
802.11h supported, for trigger measurements
see CH8

# Frame transmission, association and Authentication States

Stations的狀態依據 authenticated or unauthenticated and can be associated or unassociated 可分為三種:
1. Initial state; not authenticated and not associated
2. Authenticated but not yet associated
3. Authenticated and associated (IBSS沒有這個state, 因為IBSS沒有Association)

state machine:
![](https://i.imgur.com/nQnDxgQ.png =600x)

各class的frame如下列章節

### class 1 frame
![](https://i.imgur.com/OY4NS1L.png =550x)

### class 2 frame
![](https://i.imgur.com/l2WUGAK.png =550x)

### class 3 frame
![](https://i.imgur.com/0L1Kxzl.png =550x)

Once a station has reached State 3, it is allowed to use distribution system services and reach destinations beyond its access point. Stations may also use the power-saving services provided by access points in State 3 by using the PS-Poll frame.

If an access point receives frames from a mobile station that is authenticated but not associated, the access point responds with a Disassociation frame to bump the mobile station back to State 2.
# 補充說明
